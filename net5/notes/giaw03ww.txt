--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DETERMINING WHICH VERSION IS INSTALLED

  Version or Details tab from My Computer/Properties.
  1. Locate WinAIA.exe from My Computer.
  2. Right click the file and select Properties.
  3. Depends on Windows OS, a tab "Versions" or "Details" will have file version
     information.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROGRAM EXECUTION NOTES

  WinAIAPackage is executed as:
        WinAIA.exe [options] <command>

  Where valid options are:
        -silent
        -output-file <filename>

  And where <command> is one of the following:
        -get [group[ group[ ...]]]
        -set-from-file <filename>
        -set group.field=value [group.field=value [...]]
        -initialize
        -help


  Note: The filenames should be provided with a full path to the file. This is
        because the program actually runs from out of the %TMP% folder, and so
        the relative path is also from the %TMP% folder.

  Note: The filename for input data has each entry on a separate line, in the
        same group.field=value format.

  Note: When the silent option is provided, there is no opportunity to abort
        an update in the set modes. Without this option, there is a confirmation
        dialog.

  Note: By default, WinAIA.exe is copied to C:\DRIVERS\WINAIA.


  Examples shown below should be entered on one line. They are broken up to fit
  the 80 character width of a readme text file.

  To get everything from the user information area (UIA):
        WinAIA.exe -get

  To get only the OWNERDATA group, silently, while saving the output to a file:
        WinAIAPackage.exe -silent -output-file "\path\to\file\aia_output.txt"
        -get OWNERDATA

  To set the ASSET_NUMBER:
        WinAIA.exe -set "USERASSETDATA.ASSET_NUMBER=ABC 123"

  To set the LEASE_START_DATE
        WinAIA.exe -set LEASEDATA.LEASE_START_DATE=20130101

  To set one of the user-specifiable values:
        WinAIA.exe -set "USERDEVICE.My Field=My Value"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEVICE GROUPS AND FIELDS

  All options, group names and field names are case-insensitive, except for the
  USERDEVICE group and the prefix value.

  If no options are specified or an incorrect option is specified, then the
  help text for the utility is displayed.

  Here is a list of the valid group names and their associated fields:

  USERDEVICE         <Field1>  -  These fields are defined by the user.
                     :            The maximum number of user fields is five.
                     <Fieldn>

  PRELOADPROFILE     IMAGEDATE

                     PHONE_NUMBER
                     OWNERPOSITION

  NETWORKCONNECTION  NUMNICS
                     GATEWAY

                     SYSTEMNAME
                     LOGINNAME

  Note: The USERASSETDATA.ASSET_NUMBER is available through WMI by querying the
        SMBIOSAssetTag field of the Win32_SystemEnclosure class.
